## Getting started

###Installing the library
Install from Component Store or Clone and add project or dll to your solution.

###Usage
To display the progress fragment you will need the following code:
```
public class MyProgressFragment : ProgressFragment {

}
```

If you use MvvmCross:
Coming soon

Setup content view and empty text (optional) in OnActivityCreate() method.
```
public override void OnActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState)
{
    base.OnActivityCreated(savedInstanceState);

    //set content view
    ContentView = m_ContentView;
    //Set text for empty content
    SetEmptyText(Resource.String.empty);
}
```

Display Indeterminate progress indicator:
```
ContentShown = false;
```

When the data is loaded to set whether the content is empty and show content:
```
ContentEmpty = /*true if content is empty else false*/;
ContentShown = true;
```
